# Linear Algebra in Action: Solving Systems and Least Squares

This project showcases practical applications of linear algebra concepts using Python and NumPy. It focuses on determining linear independence, working with orthogonal projections, and solving inconsistent systems using the **least squares method**.

## üìö Topics Covered

- Linear independence and span
- Matrix multiplication and linear transformations
- Orthogonal projection of vectors
- Least squares approximation for inconsistent systems
- Visualization of linear systems in 2D and 3D

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `LA_P3.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all implementations, explanations, and visualizations.

## üîç How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-algebra-in-action.git
